        <p>
            Priceless<br>
Indecisive<br>
Worship crisis<br>
Follow me everywhere<br>
That I be hiding<br>
Stacking up cash<br>
For the first of the month<br>
Gotta look past<br>
All the diamonds and the rough<br>
Never on pause gotta redline<br>
No sleep 'til me and my dogs<br>
Make it big time woah (woah)<br>
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah<br>
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go<br>
Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho<br>
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know<br>
<br>
I don't come from a generation of wealth<br>
But a generation forced to stay in the stealth<br>
Barely live by themselves<br>
Provide for they health<br>
I been on a mission<br>
Ever since momma got cans from the Christians<br>
Fueled by the faces of ones we're missing<br>
Still have regrets, shit I should've listened<br>
Came from the bottom<br>
Had a promise never stop<br>
Wish I had a nest egg<br>
And the family drop top<br>
Where I go bar hop with my backwards hat<br>
At Harper's or Rick's where the white chicks at<br>
Picture that<br>
Juxtapose this with mismatched dads<br>
Don't suppose you could<br>
Go right back to when he met you<br>
Say "It's okay I'm not worth the hassle"<br>
<br>
Go ahead grab the stick, baby<br>
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby<br>
Haven't really felt my- (haven't really felt my)<br>
Go ahead grab the stick, baby<br>
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby<br>
Haven't really felt myself lately<br>
Haven't really been myself lately<br>
<br>
Priceless<br>
Indecisive<br>
Worship crisis<br>
Follow me everywhere<br>
That I be hiding<br>
Stacking up cash<br>
For the first of the month<br>
Gotta look past<br>
All the diamonds and the rough<br>
Never on pause gotta redline<br>
No sleep 'til me and my dogs<br>
Make it big time woah (woah)<br>
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah<br>
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go<br>
Posted with this fucking throat slit, that's for sho<br>
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know<br>
<br>
Feint to the body and I come up top<br>
We can go a round, boy, I'm the cream of the crop<br>
Right now, right now you're an enemy<br>
Pretty soon I'm the one you're worshiping<br>
Maybe then it's all behind us<br>
Save for vague reminders<br>
Who knows down the road<br>
Buy some merch and sign it<br>
But don't get excited, no<br>
Baby boy left to hiding out<br>
Too much empathizing<br>
When tragedy left me blind and out<br>
Praying every day for some time back<br>
Why'd he throw it all away for a dime bag<br>
Decade later do the same with a coke head<br>
Pleading to my brothers please stay in co-ed<br>
Maybe that's where the pain really stems from<br>
Pretty tough to explain when you're that young<br>
Since then it's a climb up the mountain<br>
But it'd help if I had some<br>
Income<br>
