But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Messin with the wrong ass people
And that shit go south
I don’t want no hoe
I don’t want no mouth
Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Bitch I’m counting on my LMA
Imma add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up

You were sitting back
Acting like you jumped
Off the fuckin’ porch
Ayy of course
Ayy of course
Ayy of course
Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Damn
Put yo body in a hole

First things first when I hit the stage
I got everybody bouncing like
They're tripped at a rave
Keep the music loud
'Cause I ain't come to behave
They said Tony slow it down a sec
Wait, okay

Scandalous, keep myself in trouble
Breaking rules like we some vandalists
Fumbling on those beats now
Give me the mic 'cause
Y'all can't handle this
Bespoke, homegrown, phenom
Prodigy, now Imma be that
Michigan's own Socrates

Fuck with me
Better bring it to the table if you
Fuck with me
Get that demo out my face
Nah, you can't fuck with me
Need to stop with all the talk
Like you in love with me
Like you in love with me
Bitch
Fuck with me
Better rethink all your choices
Don't you fuck with me
Get that skinny fist out my face
Don't you fuck with me
Better stop with all that talk
Like you could fuck with me
‘Cause you can’t fuck with me
Bitch
Light 'em up, light 'em up, light 'em up
Beat his ass down
Make him throw up all his lunch
If he's got some friends
We gon' tell 'em good luck
Because I got my army with me
And we all suited up
Upstage in the cut
When I spit, bitches done for
Then I skrrt skrt off in the 3 door
I need more, I'm too wild, too mean
Million other copies
But there's just one Tony
I'm like a
Suicide pilot
Dropping bombs
On the nose dive
Pretty soon, everyone's asking Tony for a cosign
I'm flattered,
But you're getting vetoed, little bitch
Funny, think you got a chance against the executive
Breaking limbs in the mosh pit
DJ had to stop it
Of course, course he had to stop it
Of course, course he had to stop it
Of course, of course, of course...

Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Bitch I’m counting on my LMA
Imma add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up`,

        song9: `Priceless
Indecisive
Worship crisis
Follow me everywhere
That I be hiding
Stacking up cash
For the first of the month
Gotta look past
All the diamonds and the rough
Never on pause gotta redline
No sleep 'til me and my dogs
Make it big time woah (woah)
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go
Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know

I don't come from a generation of wealth
But a generation forced to stay in the stealth
Barely live by themselves
Provide for they health
I been on a mission
Ever since momma got cans from the Christians
Fueled by the faces of ones we're missing
Still have regrets, shit I should've listened
Came from the bottom
Had a promise never stop
Wish I had a nest egg
And the family drop top
Where I go bar hop with my backwards hat
At Harper's or Rick's where the white chicks at
Picture that
Juxtapose this with mismatched dads
Don't suppose you could
Go right back to when he met you
Say "It's okay I'm not worth the hassle"

Go ahead grab the stick, baby
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby
Haven't really felt my- (haven't really felt my)
Go ahead grab the stick, baby
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby
Haven't really felt myself lately
Haven't really been myself lately

Priceless
Indecisive
Worship crisis
Follow me everywhere
That I be hiding
Stacking up cash
For the first of the month
Gotta look past
All the diamonds and the rough
Never on pause gotta redline
No sleep 'til me and my dogs
Make it big time woah (woah)
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go
Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know

Feint to the body and I come up top
We can go a round, boy, I'm the cream of the crop
Right now, right now you're an enemy
Pretty soon I'm the one you're worshiping
Maybe then it's all behind us
Save for vague reminders
Who knows down the road
Buy some merch and sign it
But don't get excited, no
Baby boy left to hiding out
Too much empathizing
When tragedy left me blind and out
Praying every day for some time back
Why'd he throw it all away for a dime bag
Decade later do the same with a coke head
Pleading to my brothers please stay in co-ed
Maybe that's where the pain really stems from
Pretty tough to explain when you're that young
Since then it's a climb up the mountain
But it'd help if I had some
