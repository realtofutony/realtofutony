I’m sailing on the ocean and the high seas
Spray upon me, like a zombie
Way my heart bleeds
Stewardess’ lips kiss me
That’s what I need, fly free
Salt coats the air and my lungs
Whenever I breathe
Likely-
Story that’s what I’m told
Ain’t a thing can do about it
That’s how life goes
Get a job obey your boss
And keep your mouth closed
Cop a wrist watch and watch the time
Tick, tick
Tick, tick
Tick tock
You know it
Might be the last time
So I say goodbyes like I’m a poet
Almost hooked on addy
But you’ll never fucking know it
I still got the pills in a place
But instilled in my will is your face
So I stay clean

I promised it wouldn’t get so deep
On this record, but irony sees
He brought us together
Now we searchin’ for seas,
Cool breeze, and warm weather
Breaking cycles, if they slice through,
We bleed forever
I’m always tangled in knots
The one they almost forgot
Can’t put me into a box
I won’t conform to your thoughts
I’ll switch it up on a dime
Long line of folks I’m coming from
I refuse to be defined by where they’re stuck
Motherfucker

Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore

Always cold in Michigan so I tell her-
[LucyV]
Bundle up baby bet this coat’ll fit you better
Cause I’m under the weather
I keeper her underwear wetter
I pop off like a beretta
Her nipples pop through her sweater
I wonder if we’ll ever travel to the deep end
How they keep it shallow
Like I’m movin’ through the weekend
Dabble in my devious ways
I keep the breeze in my face
And if you leave
You’ll never see
What kind of cheese Imma chase

To keep it real I be a softy
Chewy toffee
The makers mark’ll always haunt me
Like a ghost, do the most
To forget about my thoughts
But I’m lost on the coast
Best believe she take it off
To relieve all my woes
Nose-
Dive in complete superstition
She ask me my sign in the
Back of the kitchen
Felt less than divine
So I moved to submission
Just waste all my time
Then she said to me “listen-”

Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
(Don’t say, don’t say)
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
(Don’t say, don’t say)

[Headband Henny]
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
(Don’t say, don’t say)
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore`,
        thirtyyears: `30 years young can I
Get another talk with you
Been praying to the lord for you
Been praying to the lord for you
But all I hear is silence
Empty thoughts, broken promises
So let's turn up the violence
So let's turn up the-
Look
I don't need no one's help
Never come with a gang
I just rock by myself
But when the van pull up
Ain't nobody sleepin'
Motherfucker stand up

Dirty motherfuckers wanna hate on the process
Mad cuz a fucker ain't got much options
Been there, done that
Cease all the nonesense
Had to move from ticking ticking time bomb shit
Opulence and pots of piss
And politicians argue this
The best it gets
How I'm  supposed to
How I'm supposed to
How I'm  supposed to live a life
With the end of a knife
Point at my heart, throat, wallet despite
The positive and overwhelming spirt
I don't wanna hear it
From a motherfucker with a silver spoon
How I'm  supposed to
Fight corruption private public
Build republics
How I manage like Chael Sonnen fighting home advantage
Tell me something
Why they all defend it
Like they've always planned it
Price tag your grave
Like they own the planet
Treat us a slave
But he worked so hard
Yeah his daddy's daddy
But his daddy's daddy's daddy owned a farm
Now he drives a beamer
Hail the president
Yelling fuck the beaners
You can call me brown or you can call me white
For you headline whatever's most convenient

Heartbreaker been called that
Scream out no one call back
Apologize for the way we act
Overcompensate for the things we lack

Wasting all our time
Caught in the middle of a lie you said
Help yourself when you cry
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice yeah
Wasting all our time
Caught in the middle of a lie you said
Help yourself when you cry
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice yeah

Don't wanna play no games
Hope my waveforms reach the gates for him
Singing falsetto
Relax and revel in melodies
Flipping the recod no end in me
Tip of the hat to that better me
Are you kidding me?
Hop out the window still knock on the door
Are you kidding me?
Reach for the handle think it was a Ford
Little SUV thing
Her mom bought it for her
Living the dream
One I can't afford
Of course, directed off course, of course
Pretty little thing got me fucked up
Construct made of stone with a gold touch
I'd be lying if I say I didn't sweat it
Couple what ifs in this life
Don't you get it?
Don't you fret it
Don't forget it
In Belize send a message
Oh please, he won't get it
On your knees
Quit your begging
I'm running, I'm coming
I'm stunting, I'm fronting
I'm fed up with bodies
Pile ritual rings 'round me
Who's stopping me from going mask on
Like it's Miami
Ya tengo memories
Blood stained memories
Why were you given this life
Just to lose it all
Why this, why that
Why me

Wasting all our time
Caught in the middle of a lie you said
Help yourself when you cry
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice yeah
Wasting all our time
Caught in the middle of a lie you said
Help yourself when you cry
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice
When you roll the dice yeah`,
        grjoyride: `Okay
Crankin’ up the knobs
In my ‘02 Saturn
Wish I had a Porsche
But I guess it doesn’t matter
Should I get a good job
Or should I be a rapper?
I stay close to death
So I think I’ll take the latter
(Think I’ll take the latter)
I stay close to death
So I think I’ll take the latter
Scooping up the bros
Playing demos from my phone
Home alone
Writing poems
Instead of making wallets fatter

Fuck a 9 to 5
I was rockin’ 12 to 12
Cookin up a set list
Setting heat down from the shelf
Finally, I show my teeth
Because I did it for myself
I’m the self help guru
Lift me out my cell (flash, flash, flash)
Flash was my life in my eyes
Boarded up in fear
Shell shocked
Drums popped
I could see the end was near
I could feel the blood
I could hold a tear
I could hear diablo
Laughing at me
Grinning ear to ear
Yes another victim
Yes another prospect
Gonna bring the house down
Better lean on this house bet
Call me Charlie Olives
Don’t part ways
With your dollars yet
Checking my surroundings
The underdog has won again
Step left
Step right, step back
Any other choice
And visualize my bones crack
Wake up the next day
Business as usual
I do not dwell
On paychecks and cubicles
I cannot surround myself
With gente undevoted
If you don’t have passion projects
I won’t send my vote in
50k you’re coping
Living life feeling stoic
You know it
You know it, you know it

Crankin’ up the knobs
In my ‘02 Saturn
Wish I had a Porsche
But I guess it doesn’t matter
Should I get a good job
Or should I be a rapper?
I stay close to death
So I think I’ll take the latter
(Think I’ll take the latter)
I stay close to death
So I think I’ll take the latter
Scooping up the bros
Playing demos from my phone
Home alone
Writing poems
Instead of making wallets fatter`,
        flor: `Left my apartment all a mess
I guess that's what I get
For getting intimate with death
Caress me down my neck
Kiss me softly take my breath
Heart beats harshly I forget
The time that we have spent
Twisted melodies and harmonies
Old friends turn to enemies
It was all a dream
Sleepless nights and
Endless fights
You were my escape
My come to light

So tell me I'll be okay
Sitting in the dark when it rains
Working like a dog everyday
Wanna quit my job everyday
Wanna feel your body every night
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky

And I can't be here by my lonesome
I still cry sometimes

[VERSE 2]

So tell me I'll be okay
Sitting in the dark when it rains
Working like a dog everyday
Wanna quit my job everyday
Wanna feel your body every night
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky

And I can't be here by my lonesome
I still cry sometimes`,
        amb: `Made it to 21
Yeah, I'm feeling blessed
Prime of my time
Yet, I'm still detached
Nine more will it be the moment I meet the holy
But his sister told me
"Not your business, sit, relax"
Listen you got a point
Truth, what you're getting at
Off script, from behind
Sneak attack
But that don't change the facts
Peer inside to see the past
Pessimistic, narcissistic
With blood I write these raps

I get asked
Picked up the mic and put down your past
I get asked
Why even try when it's out your grasp
I get asked
Picked up the mic and put down your past
I get asked
Why can't you calm why can't you relax

Texting and I'm driving
On my way home
I don't pay no mind when
I go-o-o

Just say say something
When you suffer
When you're suffering

Maybe I cop a new vice
Just to cope with it
Everyday I feel my brain fried
So what's the difference
My mental be a riptide
Sometimes I swim in it
Often times there's salt in my eyes
Realize it's lingering
Face down in front my speakers
That's where you can find me
Pen in my hand
It's these sonic waves
That I confide in
Throw it all to the wind
Hoping I can catch the lightning
If you not on my side
You know that we'll be fight-

I'm to the point where I'm
Questioning all my definitions
How many of them will it take
'Fore I take these premonitions
Overclocking my mental state
For the sake of grand ambitions
Knowing only few can relate
When I'm breaking down 'round Christmas
I was never good enough
Put it all behind me
Stupid fucking rotten bastard child
That defines me
Never focus on the now
Future always blinding
Can you hear me when I shout
I'm willing to die

I get asked
Picked up the mic and put down your past
I get asked
Why even try when it's out your grasp
I get asked
Picked up the mic and put down your past
I get asked
I get- I get
I get asked`,
        ofcourse: `Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Messin with the wrong ass people
And that shit go south
I don’t want no hoe
I don’t want no mouth
Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Bitch I’m counting on my LMA
Imma add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up

You were sitting back
Acting like you jumped
Off the fuckin’ porch
Ayy of course
Ayy of course
Ayy of course
Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Damn
Put yo body in a hole

First things first when I hit the stage
I got everybody bouncing like
They're tripped at a rave
Keep the music loud
'Cause I ain't come to behave
They said Tony slow it down a sec
Wait, okay

Scandalous, keep myself in trouble
Breaking rules like we some vandalists
Fumbling on those beats now
Give me the mic 'cause
Y'all can't handle this
Bespoke, homegrown, phenom
Prodigy, now Imma be that
Michigan's own Socrates

Fuck with me
Better bring it to the table if you
Fuck with me
Get that demo out my face
Nah, you can't fuck with me
Need to stop with all the talk
Like you in love with me
Like you in love with me
Bitch
Fuck with me
Better rethink all your choices
Don't you fuck with me
Get that skinny fist out my face
Don't you fuck with me
Better stop with all that talk
Like you could fuck with me
‘Cause you can’t fuck with me
Bitch
Light 'em up, light 'em up, light 'em up
Beat his ass down
Make him throw up all his lunch
If he's got some friends
We gon' tell 'em good luck
Because I got my army with me
And we all suited up
Upstage in the cut
When I spit, bitches done for
Then I skrrt skrt off in the 3 door
I need more, I'm too wild, too mean
Million other copies
But there's just one Tony
I'm like a
Suicide pilot
Dropping bombs
On the nose dive
Pretty soon, everyone's asking Tony for a cosign
I'm flattered,
But you're getting vetoed, little bitch
Funny, think you got a chance against the executive
Breaking limbs in the mosh pit
DJ had to stop it
Of course, course he had to stop it
Of course, course he had to stop it
Of course, of course, of course...

Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off

    income: `Priceless
Indecisive
Worship crisis
Follow me everywhere
That I be hiding
Stacking up cash
For the first of the month
Gotta look past
All the diamonds and the rough
Never on pause gotta redline
No sleep 'til me and my dogs
Make it big time woah (woah)
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go
Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know

I don't come from a generation of wealth
But a generation forced to stay in the stealth
Barely live by themselves
Provide for they health
I been on a mission
Ever since momma got cans from the Christians
Fueled by the faces of ones we're missing
Still have regrets, shit I should've listened
Came from the bottom
Had a promise never stop
Wish I had a nest egg
And the family drop top
Where I go bar hop with my backwards hat
At Harper's or Rick's where the white chicks at
Picture that
Juxtapose this with mismatched dads
Don't suppose you could
Go right back to when he met you
Say "It's okay I'm not worth the hassle"

Go ahead grab the stick, baby
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby
Haven't really felt my- (haven't really felt my)
Go ahead grab the stick, baby
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby
Haven't really felt myself lately
Haven't really been myself lately

Priceless
Indecisive
Worship crisis
Follow me everywhere
That I be hiding
Stacking up cash
For the first of the month
Gotta look past
All the diamonds and the rough
Never on pause gotta redline
No sleep 'til me and my dogs
Make it big time woah (woah)
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go
Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know

Feint to the body and I come up top
We can go a round, boy, I'm the cream of the crop
Right now, right now you're an enemy
Pretty soon I'm the one you're worshiping
Maybe then it's all behind us
Save for vague reminders
Who knows down the road
Buy some merch and sign it
But don't get excited, no
Baby boy left to hiding out
Too much empathizing
When tragedy left me blind and out
Praying every day for some time back
Why'd he throw it all away for a dime bag
Decade later do the same with a coke head
Pleading to my brothers please stay in co-ed
Maybe that's where the pain really stems from
Pretty tough to explain when you're that young
Since then it's a climb up the mountain
But it'd help if I had some

Income`,
something: `Fucked up for life
You can't see this twice
Turn down the lights
Gotta get you in my sight
Only thing
That make me forget
So sweet
My hands on your neck
Gotta breathe
Keep calm and collected
Can't sleep
I lay and reflect

Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
You can't run no more
Run no more

Self made
Bitch I'm self made
Launching fucking missles
We ain't throwing shade
This shit be my bullets
Imma let it spray
Cocked it back
Look down the sights
My visions oh beautiful days
Y'all never seen nothing like this
Better bring it back to your clique
Matter of fact I ain't even trip
Seen the light
See the crowd I'm in
Seen the dark
Never count me in
I don't need a plan
When I'm walking in
My right hand
I put my trust in it

You keep hiding
You can't fight it
You keep lying
You can't run no more
Run no more
You keep hiding
You can't fight it
You keep trying
You can't run no more
Run no more`,
