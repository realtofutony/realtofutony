        song1: `Featuring: LucyV, Headband Henny
        
I’m sailing on the ocean and the high seas
Spray upon me, like a zombie
Way my heart bleeds
Stewardess’ lips kiss me
That’s what I need, fly free
Salt coats the air and my lungs
Whenever I breathe
Likely-
Story that’s what I’m told
Ain’t a thing can do about it
That’s how life goes
Get a job obey your boss
And keep your mouth closed
Cop a wrist watch and watch the time
Tick, tick
Tick, tick
Tick tock
You know it
Might be the last time
So I say goodbyes like I’m a poet
Almost hooked on addy
But you’ll never fucking know it
I still got the pills in a place
But instilled in my will is your face
So I stay clean

I promised it wouldn’t get so deep
On this record, but irony sees
He brought us together
Now we searchin’ for seas,
Cool breeze, and warm weather
Breaking cycles, if they slice through,
We bleed forever
I’m always tangled in knots
The one they almost forgot
Can’t put me into a box
I won’t conform to your thoughts
I’ll switch it up on a dime
Long line of folks I’m coming from
I refuse to be defined by where they’re stuck
Motherfucker

Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore

Always cold in Michigan so I tell her-
[LucyV]
Bundle up baby bet this coat’ll fit you better
Cause I’m under the weather
I keeper her underwear wetter
I pop off like a beretta
Her nipples pop through her sweater
I wonder if we’ll ever travel to the deep end
How they keep it shallow
Like I’m movin’ through the weekend
Dabble in my devious ways
I keep the breeze in my face
And if you leave
You’ll never see
What kind of cheese Imma chase

To keep it real I be a softy
Chewy toffee
The makers mark’ll always haunt me
Like a ghost, do the most
To forget about my thoughts
But I’m lost on the coast
Best believe she take it off
To relieve all my woes
Nose-
Dive in complete superstition
She ask me my sign in the
Back of the kitchen
Felt less than divine
So I moved to submission
Just waste all my time
Then she said to me “listen-”

Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
(Don’t say, don’t say)
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
(Don’t say, don’t say)

[Headband Henny]
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore
(Don’t say, don’t say)
Don’t say it’s not okay
My heart can’t take it anymore`,

        song5: `Left my apartment all a mess
I guess that's what I get
For getting intimate with death
Caress me down my neck
Kiss me softly take my breath
Heart beats harshly I forget
The time that we have spent
Twisted melodies and harmonies
Old friends turn to enemies
It was all a dream
Sleepless nights and
Endless fights
You were my escape
My come to light

So tell me I'll be okay
Sitting in the dark when it rains
Working like a dog everyday
Wanna quit my job everyday
Wanna feel your body every night
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky

And I can't be here by my lonesome
I still cry sometimes

[VERSE 2]

So tell me I'll be okay
Sitting in the dark when it rains
Working like a dog everyday
Wanna quit my job everyday
Wanna feel your body every night
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky
Transcends me to the sky

And I can't be here by my lonesome
I still cry sometimes`,

        song7: `Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Messin with the wrong ass people
And that shit go south
I don’t want no hoe
I don’t want no mouth
Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Bitch I’m counting on my LMA
Imma add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up

You were sitting back
Acting like you jumped
Off the fuckin’ porch
Ayy of course
Ayy of course
Ayy of course
Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Damn
Put yo body in a hole

First things first when I hit the stage
I got everybody bouncing like
They're tripped at a rave
Keep the music loud
'Cause I ain't come to behave
They said Tony slow it down a sec
Wait, okay

Scandalous, keep myself in trouble
Breaking rules like we some vandalists
Fumbling on those beats now
Give me the mic 'cause
Y'all can't handle this
Bespoke, homegrown, phenom
Prodigy, now Imma be that
Michigan's own Socrates

Fuck with me
Better bring it to the table if you
Fuck with me
Get that demo out my face
Nah, you can't fuck with me
Need to stop with all the talk
Like you in love with me
Like you in love with me
Bitch
Fuck with me
Better rethink all your choices
Don't you fuck with me
Get that skinny fist out my face
Don't you fuck with me
Better stop with all that talk
Like you could fuck with me
‘Cause you can’t fuck with me
Bitch
Light 'em up, light 'em up, light 'em up
Beat his ass down
Make him throw up all his lunch
If he's got some friends
We gon' tell 'em good luck
Because I got my army with me
And we all suited up
Upstage in the cut
When I spit, bitches done for
Then I skrrt skrt off in the 3 door
I need more, I'm too wild, too mean
Million other copies
But there's just one Tony
I'm like a
Suicide pilot
Dropping bombs
On the nose dive
Pretty soon, everyone's asking Tony for a cosign
I'm flattered,
But you're getting vetoed, little bitch
Funny, think you got a chance against the executive
Breaking limbs in the mosh pit
DJ had to stop it
Of course, course he had to stop it
Of course, course he had to stop it
Of course, of course, of course...

Young dumb broke
But my heater go off
In a SRT driving round real slow
When they see yo ass
They gon’ pull out a pole
Speed that ass down
I don’t need you too loud
When the shot go off
It gon' be right now
Bitch I’m counting on my LMA
Imma add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up
I add it up`,

        song9: `Priceless
Indecisive
Worship crisis
Follow me everywhere
That I be hiding
Stacking up cash
For the first of the month
Gotta look past
All the diamonds and the rough
Never on pause gotta redline
No sleep 'til me and my dogs
Make it big time woah (woah)
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go
Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know

I don't come from a generation of wealth
But a generation forced to stay in the stealth
Barely live by themselves
Provide for they health
I been on a mission
Ever since momma got cans from the Christians
Fueled by the faces of ones we're missing
Still have regrets, shit I should've listened
Came from the bottom
Had a promise never stop
Wish I had a nest egg
And the family drop top
Where I go bar hop with my backwards hat
At Harper's or Rick's where the white chicks at
Picture that
Juxtapose this with mismatched dads
Don't suppose you could
Go right back to when he met you
Say "It's okay I'm not worth the hassle"

Go ahead grab the stick, baby
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby
Haven't really felt my- (haven't really felt my)
Go ahead grab the stick, baby
Slam the gears, stick it in, baby
Haven't really felt myself lately
Haven't really been myself lately

Priceless
Indecisive
Worship crisis
Follow me everywhere
That I be hiding
Stacking up cash
For the first of the month
Gotta look past
All the diamonds and the rough
Never on pause gotta redline
No sleep 'til me and my dogs
Make it big time woah (woah)
If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah
Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go
Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho
Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know

Feint to the body and I come up top
We can go a round, boy, I'm the cream of the crop
Right now, right now you're an enemy
Pretty soon I'm the one you're worshiping
Maybe then it's all behind us
Save for vague reminders
Who knows down the road
Buy some merch and sign it
But don't get excited, no
Baby boy left to hiding out
Too much empathizing
When tragedy left me blind and out
Praying every day for some time back
Why'd he throw it all away for a dime bag
Decade later do the same with a coke head
Pleading to my brothers please stay in co-ed
Maybe that's where the pain really stems from
Pretty tough to explain when you're that young
Since then it's a climb up the mountain
But it'd help if I had some
