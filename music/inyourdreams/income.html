        Priceless<br>
        Indecisive<br>
        Worship crisis<br>
        Follow me everywhere<br>
        That I be hiding<br>
        Stacking up cash<br>
        For the first of the month<br>
        Gotta look past<br>
        All the diamonds and the rough<br>
        Never on pause gotta redline<br>
        No sleep 'til me and my dogs<br>
        Make it big time woah (woah)<br>
        If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah<br>
        Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go<br>
        Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho<br>
        Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know<br>
        <br>
        I don't come from a generation of wealth<br>
        But a generation forced to stay in the stealth<br>
        Barely live by themselves<br>
        Provide for they health<br>
        I been on a mission<br>
        Ever since momma got cans from the Christians<br>
        Fueled by the faces of ones we're missing<br>
        Still have regrets, shit I should've listened<br>
        Came from the bottom<br>
        Had a promise never stop<br>
        Wish I had a nest egg<br>
        And the family drop top<br>
        Where I go bar hop with my backwards hat<br>
        At Harper's or Rick's where the white chicks at<br>
        Picture that<br>
        Juxtapose this with mismatched dads<br>
        Don't suppose you could<br>
        Go right back to when he met you<br>
        Say "It's okay I'm not worth the hassle"<br>
        <br>
        Go ahead grab the stick, baby<br>
        Slam the gears, stick it in, baby<br>
        Haven't really felt my- (haven't really felt my)<br>
        Go ahead grab the stick, baby<br>
        Slam the gears, stick it in, baby<br>
        Haven't really felt myself lately<br>
        Haven't really been myself lately<br>
        <br>
        Priceless<br>
        Indecisive<br>
        Worship crisis<br>
        Follow me everywhere<br>
        That I be hiding<br>
        Stacking up cash<br>
        For the first of the month<br>
        Gotta look past<br>
        All the diamonds and the rough<br>
        Never on pause gotta redline<br>
        No sleep 'til me and my dogs<br>
        Make it big time woah (woah)<br>
        If he's talking shit, then he's asking for a beatdown woah<br>
        Put another hit, 'bout to cash it, but I let bro go<br>
        Posted with his fucking throat slit, that's for sho<br>
        Not so lucky next time, sorry, but I gotta let him know<br>
        <br>
        Feint to the body and I come up top<br>
        We can go a round, boy, I'm the cream of the crop<br>
        Right now, right now you're an enemy<br>
        Pretty soon I'm the one you're worshiping<br>
        Maybe then it's all behind us<br>
        Save for vague reminders<br>
        Who knows down the road<br>
        Buy some merch and sign it<br>
        But don't get excited, no<br>
        Baby boy left to hiding out<br>
        Too much empathizing<br>
        When tragedy left me blind and out<br>
        Praying every day for some time back<br>
        Why'd he throw it all away for a dime bag<br>
        Decade later do the same with a coke head<br>
        Pleading to my brothers please stay in co-ed<br>
        Maybe that's where the pain really stems from<br>
        Pretty tough to explain when you're that young<br>
        Since then it's a climb up the mountain<br>
        But it'd help if I had some<br>
        <br>
        Income<br>
